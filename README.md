# MNIST-SImple-Neural-Net

Training a simple nerual net on the MNIST data set and getting an accuracy of about 98% on the test set. This repo will also show the importance of normalizing values before feeding them  into a neural net. 

The second part of the notebook tries fitting the famous Le-Net on the dataset. It is interseting to see how the Le-Net performs in comparison to our initial neural net. It does marginally better, however, with significantly fewer parameters.
